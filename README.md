JavaScript Projects

I made a pizza menu, a tic-tac-toe game, and a calculator using JS with html and css 


with the pizza menu you could "order" pizza with whatever size and toppings you want and it'd show you a price for it

the tic-tac-toe game you can play against a bot winning 3 in a row would reset it and you could go again

lastly i made a calculator which has all the functions a normal calculator does, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing
